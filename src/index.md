# Introduction to Python in Environmental Sciences
Delivered by [*ARIES Doctoral Training Programme*](https://www.aries-dtp.ac.uk) & the [*Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Acquaculture Studies*](http://www.cefas.co.uk/)

## General information


* The 3-day course organised by [ARIES DTP](https://www.aries-dtp.ac.uk/) and [Cefas](https://www.cefas.co.uk/) giving a hands-on introduction to [Python](http://www.python.org/) programming language.
* You will learn Python programming, starting from the basics, and evolving into data analysis and visualisation using data formats commonly used in environmental sciences. If you have no programming experience in any language, it is recommended that  you take a 1-2 hour online course, such as [Python Basics on datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science), to get confortable with basic concepts such as variables. 
* Suitable for both python novices and intermediate users.
* In person course at the UEA ([Queens Building](https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/campus-map), room 2.22). Lunch and refreshments will be provided.
* We will offer a limited number of places online for ARIES studends that are not registered with the UEA and CEFAS staff based in Weymouth.
